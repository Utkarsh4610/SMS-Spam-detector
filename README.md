# SMS-Spam-detector
Spam detection plays an important role in business and other areas. It uses the concept of Natural Language Processing. In this project, I implemented the classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Then combined these different algorithms to make a voting classifier to increase the reliability of the output. Then deployed this project on Heroku using Flask.
